# RBTree
We have three arrays of Inorder, Postorder and Preorder which consist the color of node i.e ‘R’ or ‘B’ . We know that in Preorder we first get root node, so in preorder array first position is root node. Simalarly in postorder root node is last, so in postorder array last position is root node.
But in inorder we cannot tell which position is root node,so the task is to find root node in inorder array .
